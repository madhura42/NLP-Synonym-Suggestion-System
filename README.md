Synonym Suggestion System using Word Embeddings

**Abstract**
Word Embeddings have been used in various Natural Language Processing tasks. Recent methods of learning vector space representations of words have succeeded in capturing semantic and syntactic regularities in vector space. In this project the main aim has been to use these word embeddings for generating synonyms that could be used to improve the quality of writing. This technique gives us the advantage of taking the context of a particular word into consideration. A regular dictionary framework may give synonyms which may not be used in the same context.

**Introduction**
Drafting documents is an implied part of most positions of employment. Most employees from technical backgrounds get engrossed in the prime job at hand, and lose command over their writing skills. This disengagement from writing, can lead to grammatical flaws and/or spelling errors and also lead to use of stagnant vocabulary. Such errors cause the drafted document to look unprofessional and leave a bad impression. Also, engineering students and students from other technical backgrounds lose touch with essay writing skills, which are an important part of most competitive exams these days. Although Text Editors often provide grammar and spell check, they miss out on certain semantic errors. Vocabulary enhancement is also absent, and mostly inadequate in most editors. Hence, this project aims at creating a tool to help students/professionals draft grammatically correct document with eloquent vocabulary which will also help them improve their writing skills. Since the preexisting Grammar/Spell Check tools give adequate results, our focus will be on generating synonyms using Word Embeddings. Not limiting the applications of synonym usage to drafting and improvisation of documents, they can be used in other areas as well. This concept can be used to measure how similar two sentences are. This idea can be extended further to refine plagiarism checkers. Text matching, after taking synonyms into consideration, can improve Answer Checking Algorithms drastically. This approach can also be used to simplify text.

**1. Grammar and Spell Check Module**
This module performs the first part of the checking and suggesting process. It is responsible for detecting and suggesting corrections for grammatical and spelling errors. After typing the text or uploading an already written document, the user makes an API call grammarCheck() which detects the grammatical, spelling or semantic errors if present and generates their respective corrections. This list of suggested corrections is presented to the user, which he/she may choose to employ or ignore. For this process, we have used a library called LanguageTool.

**2. The Synonym Generation Module** 
This is the second module and the main focus of our project. This module aims at generating a list of synonyms for a given word. The previous module will ensure the eradication of spelling errors, thereby preventing errors in this one. This module is an especially interactive one. The user selects the word for which he/she wishes to view the synonyms, and the suggested synonym list is rendered for the user. The user may then select the synonym of his/her choice and the word will get replaced by the selected synonym. Here, we have used Word Embeddings for generating synonyms. Word Embeddings are the vector representation of words which capture the context, semantic and syntactic similarity of words.The word vectors used in our project have been generated using the GloVe unsupervised learning algorithm. Synonyms have been generated by finding word vectors having high cosine similarity with the selected word. This is based on the assumption that since synonyms are used in a semantically similar way, their word vectors when plot in space will have a lower angle between them, and hence a high cosine similarity. After the user is satisfied with the document, he/she may download the document in any available format.

**3. The Feedback based Improvisation Module**
This module focuses on improving system output through user operation. After the user is done improvising the document and satisfied with the result, we will use the enhanced document to re-train our Word Vectors and improve accuracy of synonym prediction. The idea behind this module is that, through user operation irrelevant and faulty suggestions will get filtered and eliminated. In case the document has any new words, or certain words used different contexts, the new words and semantics will also be captured by our model thus improving the output.

Table shows the comparison between the outputs produced by the different technologies.
Although the results of the GloVe Embeddings contain some noisy or irrelevant words, these can be filtered out through human feedback as mentioned in the Feedback based Improvisation Module

**Time taken**

Figure shows the time taken by various technologies to generate synonyms as discussed before.
It is evident from the above figure that GloVe Word Embeddings consistently take less time to generate synonyms as compared to Thesaurus and Wordnet.
