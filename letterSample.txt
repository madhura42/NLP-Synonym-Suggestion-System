Dear Sanjay

Hi! You are invited to my birthday party on 25th August. 
The party will be at Archie’s Place, Nehru Park from 4:00 to 7:00 PM. As the party is based on ‘Spiderman’ theme, please wear a dress in red / black colour combination. It will be fun as I have arranged a Mask game, a ‘Spidey’ web game and a never – seen – before neon light and music show. I am very excited as I will wear the special Spidey costume designed by my sister. Please come as it will be good to have your company. Also, bring your brother Saurav. 
Waiting for your confirmation.

Gaurav
